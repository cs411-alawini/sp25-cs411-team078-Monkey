## Project Summary

StudyLync is a real-time, interactive platform that helps UIUC students easily find and join study groups for their courses. Users can input the information for the course that they’re studying for and drop a pin to mark their current study spot. Other students on the platform, studying for the same course, will be able to view locations of those students and join them for a study session. In addition to the dynamic study map, the platform will feature a study session planner, allowing users to schedule future study groups and receive notifications about new sessions. StudyLync combines real-time geolocation with course-based filtering to provide a dynamic-location based solution to the issue of finding and coordinating study groups – encouraging collaboration and boosting productivity for students.
